# Work Pipeline

This is the introduction of the work pipeline followed by our team, which involves a series of stages to guide us to collaborate well.

A new issue or feature is gathered from the requirements document, or bugs existing in the project after testing. The issue includes contributing documents.

All issues will be added to the Kanban board based on a platform called [Taiga](taiga.io), and assigned to someone in the team.

While contributing, everyone should follow the [workflow](/docs/Workflow.md) to make sure the patchset you pushed is bug-free mostly. The workflow includes:
- read the issue and understand fully
- finish the work following the requirements
- pass tests locally
- push your work (check more details in [workflow](/docs/Workflow.md))
- pass the CI test first
- once got CI passed, ask for Code Review (CR) from others
- merge your work after getting approval from at least two people

Besides, deployment and product review have not been decided yet.

For further development, there should be
- Knowledge Sharing Session: broadcast the technologies you used to all team members
- Learning Resources: provide more online tutorial docs related to all previous learning
- Documentation: maintain project documentation
- CI/CD: transfer to Jenkins for automating the testing and deployment processes
