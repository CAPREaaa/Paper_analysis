## Usability Cohort Design

[toc]

## Introduction

A usability cohort design is a strategy used in user experience (UX) research to test and improve the usability of a product by observing different groups of uses (cohorts) interacting with it. The initial step in the cohort design process is to identify and define user characters. These characters are fictional ones that represent the different user types who might use the academic paper analysis system. Each user's role have specific characteristics, goals, and behaviors that reflect the variety of users within the target demographic. For example, a character might be a "Graduate Researcher" who requires advanced search capabilities to find specialized papers, or an "Academic Librarian" who needs to assist students with sourcing literature.

## Implementations

For the usability cohort design of the academic paper analysis system project, a usability cohort plan would involve identifying target user groups that represent the system's potential user base. These cohorts are selected to ensure a wide range of perspectives on the system's usability. Each cohort would be given a series of tasks related to the analysis and management of academic papers to identify usability issues. 


**Step 1: Identify the target user groups**

For our first step, we need to identify and characterize the principal user cohorts for the system:

- **Researcher Cohorts**

Researchers are a primary target user group for this system. They include individuals from various academic disciplines who actively engage in scholarly research and require tools to analyze academic papers effectively. Researchers may have different levels of experience, ranging from early-career researchers to seasoned academics. They may specialize in specific fields or have interdisciplinary interests. Understanding the diverse needs and expectations of researchers is essential to ensure the system caters to their requirements.
