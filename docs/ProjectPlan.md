# Project Plan


## Introduction

The project aims to develop a platform to analyze academic papers in different formats uploaded by the user, illustrating multiple relationships to help researchers find the connection among them.

We are planning to develop a web application powered by separate front-end and back-end with a database, having a three-tier architecture to present, handle logic and manage data resources. The front-end supports the user to interact through their web browser, and their actions will be sent to the back-end. The back-end processes the request, involves querying the database, and sends the data back to the front-end, updating the user interface. This architecture can make our application more organized, scalable, and easier to develop and maintain. Each layer can be developed independently using suitable technologies.


## General tasks
1. **Links between Authors**: Identify and visualize the co-authorship and collaborative networks among authors, highlighting their shared works and impact within the academic community.
2. **Links between Topics**: Analyze and map the relationships between various research topics, showing how they intersect and evolve over time.
3. **Clusters of Paper around Topics**: Group papers by related topics using keyword analysis and metadata to form clusters that represent the landscape of research in specific areas.
4. **Paper Reference Networks**: Construct visual networks that display the citation relationships between papers, showcasing the lineage and influence of scholarly works.
5. **Upload Resources (PDF/doc)**: Allow users to upload academic resources in various formats for analysis and inclusion in the applicationâ€™s dataset.
6. **Extract Information from Resources**: Implement algorithms to automatically extract and process information from uploaded documents, such as titles, authors, keywords, and references.
7. **Interactive Visualization**: Create dynamic and interactive visualizations that enable users to explore the data, uncover insights, and understand the relationships within the academic landscape.
