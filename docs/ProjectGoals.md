From my point of view, the main goal of our software project is to develop a system for the analysis of academic papers and other sources, enabling researchers and analysts to perform in-depth examinations on aspects including authorship, sentiment, theme, and topic. The system would focus on running complex analysis queries, including identifying clusters of papers around topics, links between authors and topics, and possibly sentiment analysis. Additionally, our system would try to explore analysis of how papers and articles are interconnected. Overall, we would focus on delivering a platform that supports interactive analysis and real-time query processing.

The final aim of this project is to create a versatile analysis system that can deal with academic papers. This system will have the capability to take in and store data, changing it into a format that's easy to analyze and keeping it in the right kind of databases. We plan to build a layer for analysis and querying that lets clients dig deep into the data, looking into the authors, main themes, and key points, and also to find the main links between different papers. We're also going to make a system that allows for many kinds of visual displays, so the results of the analysis can be shown in pictures or words, supporting hands-on analysis and quick, almost real-time responses to queries. Lastly, we'll set up ways to keep an eye on how the data is used and how the queries are done, so we can make the storage and searching of data as efficient as possible.

The goal of this project should gather the information properly including basic data and the specific block of data that  clients want, which means the clients want to find the relationships or links among all sources. The sources can be updated by the clients as well through uploading. And the output should be visualized.  The main part of the project is to find a way to analysis queries via processing the raw data from different formats, proper database design and etc. Meanwhile, trying to design the system efficiently regarding to the complexity of the project, selecting light, quick, but sufficient tech stack.
